        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Science student recently graduated from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, with a Bachelor of Science and a Business Administration minor. With an exchange semester at the University of Nottingham, I bring a global perspective to my work. I am proficient in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and R, with expertise in MongoDB, SQLite, Flask, Bottle, REST APIs, and tools like Git and VS Code. My projects include AchieveIT, a full-stack user review platform with secure authentication, a wine quality data analysis using Pandas and Seaborn, and an Android audiobook player built with Java. Currently, I am pursuing IBM and Microsoft certifications, blending technical skills with a passion for innovation and collaboration.</p>
